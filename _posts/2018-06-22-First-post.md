Well... it is quite some time I'm thinking about having a blog and now the time has come.

I explored some alternatives like Medium and Wordpress but then I found out that it is possible to use Jekyll to generate static sites hosted on Github.

Even better, someone (Barry Clark) already prepared a static blog site made in Jekyll and [ready to be forked](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on Github.

I think this will make posting easy and effective ... we'll see ...
